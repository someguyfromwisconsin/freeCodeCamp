            <p>Scope refers to the context in which variables are declared and accessed. It defines the visibility and accessibility of variables in different parts of your code. JavaScript has two main types of scope: global scope and local scope.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Global Scope:

                    Variables declared outside of any function or block have a global scope.
                    They can be accessed from any part of the code, including within functions.
                    Be cautious with global variables, as they can lead to naming conflicts and make it harder to manage your code.</li>
                    <code>var globalVariable = 10;

                        function exampleFunction() {
                            console.log(globalVariable); // Accessible
                        }
                        </code>
                <li>Local Scope:

                    Variables declared within a function or block have a local scope.
                    They are only accessible within the function or block where they are declared.
                    This helps encapsulate variables and avoids naming conflicts with variables in other parts of the code.</li>
                    <code>function exampleFunction() {
                        var localVariable = 20;
                        console.log(localVariable); // Accessible
                    
                        if (true) {
                            var anotherLocalVariable = 30;
                            console.log(anotherLocalVariable); // Accessible
                        }
                    }
                    
                    console.log(localVariable); // Error, not accessible outside the function
                    console.log(anotherLocalVariable); // Accessible, as it is declared with 'var'

            <header>The Ternary/Conditional Operator</header>
            <p>The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write an if-else statement in a single line of code. It takes three operands and evaluates a condition. If the condition is true, it returns the value of the first operand; otherwise, it returns the value of the second operand. The general syntax is as follows:</p>
            <code>condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse;
            </code>
            <ul>
                <li>condition: This is the expression that is evaluated. If the condition is truthy, the expression before the : is executed; otherwise, the expression after the : is executed.</li>
                <li>expressionIfTrue: The value returned if the condition is true./li>
                <li>expressionIfFalse: The value returned if the condition is false.</li>
            </ul>
            <code>var isRaining = true;
                var weather = isRaining ? "Take an umbrella" : "Enjoy the sun";
                
                console.log(weather); // Output: "Take an umbrella"
